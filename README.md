# MemeIO
"Post Your Memes Here"
MemeIO is a small Django project that I made inspired by https://www.programmerhumor.io.
Watching memes is funny, why not make a forum for it (?? I don't even know at this point)
It feels weird writing a README.md for some reason, so I'll make this very quick.

## Built With
- Python        (Obviously) | Django
- HTML CSS      (Obviously) | Pure HTML CSS

## Trying Things Out
Sorry, I don't have the money nor the resources to try and host this online.
You can always try forking this repository and running it on your machine. "It WoRkEd On My MaChInE".
If you have issues, please report. I only spent 10 minutes reviewing the whole app.

> py manage.py runserver

## Usage?
You can use this project if you want. If you happen to copy and paste one of the very few lines of code that I wrote for myself,
Well I don't think I'll care. You can do whatever you want.
